# Team Name: Tech Pirates
# Project Title: Virtual Carpooling Network
# Project Name : Rideमित्र 
# Project Description:
Our project, Virtual Carpooling Network, is an innovative platform that empowers employees of large companies to conveniently arrange carpooling options based on shared commute routes and schedules. With a user-friendly interface and intelligent matching algorithm, employees are matched with others traveling on similar paths at overlapping times, encouraging efficient carpooling practices. The system provides a seamless carpool experience, promoting cost-sharing, reducing traffic congestion, and lowering carbon emissions, while also offering incentives like preferential parking and toll discounts.

# Key Features:
Real-time Matching Algorithm: Employees are dynamically matched with others based on similar routes and schedules.
Ride Creation & Management: Drivers can create rides, manage schedules, and view details of available rides.
Profile Customization: Each user can update their profile and view personal ride history.
Commute Optimization: The system analyzes commute data to provide optimal route suggestions and timing.
Secure Data Handling: Secure data management of user details and rides, with advanced encryption for sensitive information.
Seamless Backend Integration: A robust backend infrastructure using MongoDB and Express.js for smooth API handling and database management.
Environment-friendly Solution: Promotes eco-friendly travel alternatives by encouraging carpooling, thus reducing traffic and emissions.

# Technologies Used:

## Frontend:

React.js: Dynamic user interfaces, seamless state management, and component-based architecture.
HTML5 & CSS3: For structured content and sleek, responsive styling.
Axios: Simplified HTTP requests for communication between frontend and backend.

## Backend:

Node.js & Express.js: High-performance backend framework, ensuring efficient routing and API functionality.
MongoDB: A NoSQL database for managing user profiles, rides, and commute data with flexible schema.
Mongoose: Elegant MongoDB object modeling for Node.js to structure data and interaction.
Cors: Middleware to enable Cross-Origin Resource Sharing, ensuring safe interaction between frontend and backend.

## Tools & Deployment:

Git: Version control for seamless collaboration.
Postman: API testing and validation.
Heroku (Optional): Future-proof deployment for hosting the full stack app.

# Conclusion:
Our project is a game-changer in how employees of large organizations commute daily. Leveraging modern technologies, the Virtual Carpooling Network creates a seamless, eco-friendly commuting option, all while simplifying carpool coordination with cutting-edge algorithms and secure backend handling.
